# EVM Notes

A structured knowledge base covering low-level EVM mechanics, Solidity internals, and smart contract security patterns.

This repository is not a tutorial.  
It is a technical reference built from research, experimentation, and production observations.

---

## Scope

The goal of this repo is to document:

- Solidity internals
- EVM storage mechanics
- Gas optimization strategies
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Attack simulations & mitigation techniques

Content focuses on implementation details, not high-level explanations.
